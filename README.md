# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to show how earthquakes occur in relation to the tectonic plates' location around the world. With this map we will be able to see where earthquakes with over a magnitude of 5 have occurred in relation to the tectonic plates. Just for fun these visualization can be seen on three different types of maps.
